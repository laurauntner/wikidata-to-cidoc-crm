Make sure you have the tools installed:

pip install --upgrade build twine

Make code changes, edit files only inside src/wiki2crm/, do not edit anything in dist/, build/, or *.egg-info.

Bump the version number in pyproject.toml:

[project]
version = "0.1.4"

Clean old build artifacts – from repository root: 

rm -rf dist/ build/ wiki2crm.egg-info

Build the package:

python3 -m build

You should now see:

dist/
├── wiki2crm-0.1.4.tar.gz
└── wiki2crm-0.1.4-py3-none-any.whl

Verify the package:

twine check dist/*

Test install locally:

pip install dist/wiki2crm-0.1.5-py3-none-any.whl

Then:

python3 -c "import wiki2crm; print(wiki2crm.__version__)"

Upload to PyPI:

Test PyPI:

twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

Install from Test PyPI:

pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ wiki2crm

Production PyPI:

twine upload dist/*

You’ll be prompted for your PyPI API token.

Finally: Update release on GitHub and Zenodo.
